# Introduction

Happiness is an emotional state characterized by feelings of joy, fulfillment, satisfaction and contentment. It has many distinct definitions and is frequently associated with positive emotions and life satisfaction. When most people talk about happiness, they may be referring to how they feel in the present moment or to a broader sense of how they feel about life in general.How happy are people today? Were people happier in the past? How satisfied are people in different societies with their lives? And how do our living conditions affect all of this? These are difficult questions to answer, but they are surely important to each of us individually. Indeed, today, life satisfaction and happiness are becoming important study topics in the social sciences, including in ‘mainstream’ economics. In this study, we will explore the data and empirical evidence that may provide answers to these questions. Our focus here will be on survey-based measures of World Happiness by country.


## Problems

1. Which countries are on the Top 10 Happiness Countries list?

2. Which countries are on the Top 10 Progressive Countries list?

3. Which factor affects people's happiness the most?

4. Which regression model is the best to predict the happiness scores?

5. Which classification model is the best to predict happiness levels?


## Objective

- This study aims to both quantify and analyze well-being around the world. Our main goal is to do an exploratory analysis of the factors that make people happy.

- To predict happiness score through different regression models

- To predict happiness level through two classification models



# Data Preprocessing

## Dataset

World Happiness Report


Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness

The title of the datasets that we get is "World Happiness Report". The datasets are from 2015 to 2019 and they are located separately in different CSV files. It has 8 to 12 variables in each CSV, with almost 155 different countries, which is the dependent variable in this study. The independent variables are the factors that affect people's happiness such as family, freedom, life expectancy, GDP per capita, generosity, and trust in government corruption.


The content of these happiness scores and rankings use data come from the Gallup World Poll. The scores are based on answers to the main life evaluation question asked in the poll. This question, known as the Cantril ladder, asks respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a 10 and the worst possible life being a 0 and to rate their own current lives on that scale.


The datasets need to be cleaning and tidy up by renaming the variables so that they are all titled the same in five CSV files, combining them, and ensuring that there are no uncommon data or missing values in this dataset.


## Data Column understanding

- Country

- Happiness rank

- Happiness score

This is obtained from a sample of population. The survey-taker asked the respondent to rate their happiness from 1 to 10.

- Economic (GDP per cap)

Extend of GDP that contributes to the happiness score

- Family

To what extend does family contribute to the happiness score

- health (life expectancy)

Extend of health (life expectancy) contribute to the happiness score

- Freedom

Extend of freedom that contribute to happiness. The freedom here represents the freedom of speech, freedom to pursue what we want, etc

- Trust (Government corruption)

Extend of trust with regards to government corruption that contribute to happiness score

- Generosity

Extend of generosity that contribute to happiness score

                                  ))
colnames(happy16_df)
```


### <a style="color:blue;">Insert year column at first position (index 0)</a>

```{r}
happy15_df<-cbind(Year=2015,happy15_df)

happy16_df<-cbind(Year=2016,happy16_df)

happy17_df<-cbind(Year=2017,happy17_df)

happy18_df<-cbind(Year=2018,happy18_df)

happy19_df<-cbind(Year=2019,happy19_df)
```


### Change column type for emerging dataset

```{r}
happy18_df$Trust..Government.Corruption. = as.numeric(happy18_df$Trust..Government.Corruption.)

str(happy18_df)
```


## Merge data from 2015-2019

```{r}
happy15_16<-dplyr::bind_rows(happy15_df,happy16_df)

happy15_16_17<-dplyr::bind_rows(happy15_16,happy17_df)

df<-dplyr::bind_rows(happy18_19,happy15_16_17)

head(df)
```


## Change Happiness.Rank data type 

```{r}
df$Happiness.Rank  = as.numeric(df$Happiness.Rank )

str(df)
```


## Remove unnessesary columns


count NA value in every column

```{r}
colSums(is.na(df))
```

Remove unnessesary columns

```{r}
df = subset(df, select = -c(Lower.Confidence.Interval,Upper.Confidence.Interval,Dystopia.Residual,Standard.Error,Whisker.high,Whisker.low))

colSums(is.na(df))
```


## Impute with mean or median values for numerical columns

```{r}
df$Trust..Government.Corruption.[is.na(df$Trust..Government.Corruption.)] <- median(df$Trust..Government.Corruption., na.rm = T)

colSums(is.na(df))
```


## Filter uncommon data in Country Column

Due to the data is describing the happiness score and relative factors for countries across different years. So, it is important to view the uniformity of the data in Year column of the data.


Country and Region counts group by Year

```{r}
aggregate(df$Country, by=list(df$Year), FUN=length)
```

From the table shown as above, the number of countries involved in this dataset for different year is different. Therefore, it is necessary to make an intersection of them to get the most common country list.

```{r}
Country_2015 = subset(df, Year == 2015)$Country
Country_2016 = subset(df, Year == 2016)$Country
Country_2017 = subset(df, Year == 2017)$Country
Country_2018 = subset(df, Year == 2018)$Country
Country_2019 = subset(df, Year == 2019)$Country
```

```{r}
common_country =intersect(intersect(intersect(intersect(Country_2015,
Country_2016),Country_2017),Country_2018),Country_2019)
length(common_country)
```

Therefore, there are 141 countries' data existing across from 2015-2019 in this dataset.Then we need to filter the original dataset by this common_country list.

```{r}
df1 = subset(df,Country %in% common_country)
print(paste("The amount of rows in the dataset is: ",dim(df1)[1]))
print(paste("The amount of columns in the dataset is: ",dim(df1)[2]))
```

## Fill value for categorical columns

Create a new dataset for storing common region and country

```{r}
common_region <- unique(subset(df1, Region!="NA", c(Country, Region)))

head(common_country)
```

Fill relate region to missing value of region column

```{r}
assign_region <- function(x){
  Region <- common_region$Region[common_region$Country == x]
}

for(country in common_country)
      df1$Region[df1$Country == country] <- assign_region(country)
```


## Save cleaned dataset

```{r}
write_csv(df1, path = "World Happiness Data (2015-2019)_cleaned.csv")
```


### Briefly statistic view the data

```{r}
skimr::skim_without_charts(df1)
```

```{r}
print(paste("The amount of rows in the dataset is: ",dim(df)[1]))
print(paste("The amount of columns in the dataset is: ",dim(df)[2]))
print(paste("the column names in this dataset are:", paste(shQuote(colnames(df)), collapse=", ")))
```

```


## Explore data by factors

```{r}
colnames(df1)
```

```{r}
head(df1)
```


### The mean value of the factors

```{r}
df1 %>%
  summarise(gdp = mean(Economy..GDP.per.Capita.),
            family = mean(Family),
            life.expectancy = mean(Health..Life.Expectancy.),
            freedom = mean(Freedom),
            generosity = mean(Generosity),
            corruption = mean(Trust..Government.Corruption.)) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(gdp, family, life.expectancy,freedom,generosity, corruption),
               names_to = "f", values_to = "value") %>%
  ggplot(aes(reorder(f, value), value)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "darkgreen", width = 0.55, alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(value, 2)), vjust = -0.5)) +

```

An (adjusted) R2 that is close to 1 indicates that a large proportion of the variability in the outcome has been explained by the regression model.

A number near 0 indicates that the regression model did not explain much of the variability in the outcome.

Our adjusted R2 is 0.7697, which is good.

# Discussion

## <a style="color:blue;">Happiness Countries from 2015 to 2019</a>

Although the top 10 happiest country's ranking position changes from year to year, the countries did not change from 2015 to 2019. They are still on the top 10 happiest country list. The countries are Finland, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, New Zealand, Canada and Australia.

## <a style="color:blue;">Progressive Countries from 2015 to 2019</a>

The top 10 progressive countries are Benin, Togo, Ivory Coast, Burundi, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Gabon, Cambodia, Honduras and Congo (Brazzaville). The happiness value of people in these countries did not declined, and the people are getting happier every year.

## <a style="color:blue;">The Main Factor Affects Happiness</a>

The factor that most affect happiness is Economic GDP per capita, It is probably because income can let people meet their basic needs, so it is quite important and will affect people's happiness, and another main factor is health.

## <a style="color:blue;">Happiness Score Prediction (Regression Model)</a>

Random Forest Regression comes out with the best result compared to others, Support Vector Regression model and Multiple Linear Regression are good in prediction. And finally, Decision Tree was the worst algorithm to predict happiness scores.

## <a style="color:blue;">Happiness Level Prediction (Classification Model)</a>

K-Nearest Neighbor Classification model is better than Naive Bayes Classification model in our project result since the prediction accuracy of K-Nearest Neighbor Classification model is higher than the other one.



# Conclusion

In conclusion, this study has shown that happiness depends on a huge range of inﬂuences. Thus, regular collection of happiness data on a large scale can inform policy-making and help us identify what "deliverables" should be created to foster well-being. In other words, moving to a happier country could plausibly make you happier. By the same token, moving to a less happy country could reduce your level of happiness. Emotions are contagious, even at a national level.
